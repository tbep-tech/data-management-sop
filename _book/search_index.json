Workflow (e..g, operationalizing Twitter scraping), dataset (field/lab data), model products, etc. Ask yourself, who is going to use this and how do I make their lives easier by opening the data using FAIR principles? The FAIR principles (very broad, emphasize throughout), also general open science definition and how data relates to open science (channel PeerJ paper distinction) 3.2 Specific concepts Specific concepts (particularly for tabular data) an overview of tidy data, can a machine read it? normalized tables (including discussion of key variables), what are unique ids (e.g., tberf oyster, how did I make the unique id?), facilitate standard DB queries metadata documentation (min requirements, relevant standards) types of data products (e.g., raw data, models, synthesized/derived data, etc.) or types of data (flat file, spatial, disparate) how-to cookbooks for data prep (could speak to different parts of the analysis workflow, e.g., project inception, mid-project, post-project/damage control) for archival, naming conventions (e.g., no spaces, short but descriptive, etc.), data dictionaries where do data live long-term, whats a doi, considering a data paper, federated repository, etc. GitHub repository Stable URL Official repository "],["workflow.html", "Section 4 Data Management Workflow", " Section 4 Data Management Workflow Setup some kind of flow chart (if this, then that) What type of project am I working on?
