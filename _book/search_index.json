Beck 2021-01-11 Section 1 Overview 1.1 Contributing to this document This SOP was created using bookdown and the source code is available on the TBEP GitHub group web page here: https://github.com/tbep-tech/data-management-sop. Each section is a plain .Rmd text file that can be edited or commented to provide feedback on content. There are several ways you can contribute to or edit this document. Before you choose your editing option, you should be comfortable with Git/GitHub basics and have some working knowledge of RMarkdown files. Jenny Bryans Happpy Git and GitHub for the useR is an excellent resource to get started with version control. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide is a great resource for learning RMarkdown. 1.1.1 Option 1 Requires: GitHub account, write access to the source code repository Each section can be edited directly by selecting the edit button at the top of the page. Clicking on the edit button will take you to GitHub, where you will see an edit page like this: Each edit page is specific to the section where youve selected the edit button, e.g., if you select edit button for section 2, youll be sent to the edit page for the .Rmd file for section 2. Feel free to make any changes on the .Rmd file. When youre done, scroll to the bottom and commit your changes. This simply means you write a few words describing the edits youve made. Be as succinct as possible. When youre done, hit the green Commit changes button. 1.1.2 Option 2 Requires: Github account Follow the above steps in option 1.1.1 by navigating to a section youd like to edit and selecting the edit button. If you dont have write access to the repository, you will see something like this: This simply means that you do not have write access to this repository and you need to create your own copy to edit. Once editing is done, you can submit a pull request to the original repository with your proposed changes. Not sure what this means? Check out this chapter here: https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html 1.1.3 Option 3 Requires: GitHub account If none of the above sounds appealing, you can always post any suggestions or edits as an issue under the issues tab of the repository. When you create a new issue by clicking the giant green New issue button, youll see something like this: Give your issue a short but informative title (e.g., suggests edits to section 2). Under the Write tab, explain what edits or changes youd like to see. Feel free to select a member of the TBEP staff to assign the issue. The issues descriptions support Markdown syntax, so get create (i.e., make lists, link to documents, etc.). In general, one issue should cover only one change. However, multiple text edits to the same document can be submitted to the same issue so long as they cover similar topics. 1.1.4 Option 4 Requires: Email Just email me any changes youd like to see.
