# Data Management Workflow {#workflow}

This section describes our approach to managing data internally, to help describe what we do and why we do it.  This is context for section \@ref(howyou) that provides a road map for opening internal or external datasets.  

## The TBEP approach

* The TBEP data [QMP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DyA0PNHV8rEXGMwGiyS7sXY1ECLYpJJO/view?usp=sharing) [@tbep1620]: what, why, how
* The Open Science cake, what it is and how we do we implement it,  figure \@ref(fig:cake)

```{r cake, fig.cap = 'The open science cake showing the connection between research, environmental decisions, and the public.'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/cake.png')
```

* General workflow - source to product, figure \@ref(fig:osworkflow)

```{r osworkflow, fig.cap = 'The TBEP open science workflow connecting source data to decision-support products.'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/os-workflow.png')
```

* GitHub as a collaborative tool and quasi-archive
     * version control
     * collaborative tool to work together - issues, pull requests
     * DOI through Zenodo
     * Automation with GitHub Actions and badges
     * GitHub linkage to TBEP website
* The tbeptools package as central component
     * How does the package facilitate the above?

## How can you manage data? {#howyou}

* Section is written as a road map for developing a data product, there will be steps/checkboxes/forms, roughly following figure \@ref(fig:dataworkflow)

```{r dataworkflow, fig.cap = 'A hypothetical and generalized timeline for managing data associated with a project.', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/dataworkflow.png')
```

* Modularity is key to reproducibility, it is independent of where you're at in the project
* Setup some kind of flow chart (if this, then that)

Where am I at with the project (beginning, middle, end/damage control)?

### I'm at the beginning of my project

* What type of project am I working on? 
* What types of products am I expecting?
* How do I want to make the data accessible?

### I'm somehwere in the middle of my project

* Have I collected data?
* Are my data in tidy format (if tabular)? 
* Have I been documenting metadata? 

### I'm at the end of my project

* Time for damage control
