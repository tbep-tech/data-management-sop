<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 4</span> Data Management Workflow</h1>
<p>This section is in two parts to first describe a workflow that we use internally at TBEP to manage our data and then to describe a road map for opening internal or external datasets at your own organization. The first section expands on our philosophy for using open science to manage data, including specific workflows we use, as context to the second section. Our approach is one way of applying open science to managing data. Applying the same approach at your organization may or may not be appropriate depending on your internal and external needs for managing data. As such, our approach is generalizable and modular - any of the approaches can be modified in part or together for your own needs.</p>
<div id="the-tbep-approach" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The TBEP approach</h2>
<div id="philo" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Our philosophy</h3>
<p>Sections <a href="background.html#opengeneral">2.3</a> and <a href="background.html#philogeneral">2.4</a> introduced you to our basic philosophy and approach to managing data at TBEP. As an organization that facilitates science, management, and outreach activities among our local partners, we adopt open science as a cornerstore strategy that will serve the Program’s core values. This approach is made explicit in our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xohuoaHDxNHRqgXoOHdI37FpWvac_rn/view?usp=sharing">Strategic Plan</a> that describes how we achieve programmatic goals defined under our <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/cf7b3c48-d2b2-4713-921c-c2a0d4466632">Comprehensive conservation and Management Plan</a> (CCMP) and who we can work with in our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJcWxmc5SeyDTqiCQ3MLQGWEY_EDGtZT/view?usp=sharing">Interlocal Agreement</a> to help us achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Our data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DyA0PNHV8rEXGMwGiyS7sXY1ECLYpJJO/view">Quality Management Plan</a> (QMP, <span class="citation">E.T. Sherwood, G. Raulerson, M. Beck, M. Burke (<a href="#ref-tbep1620" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) is a companion document to this SOP that ensures the data used by TBEP for decision-making has known and documented quality and is being used appropriately. The QMP establishes an internal process for verifying data quality standards that conform with federal requirements we have as an organization funded in part by federal dollars under Section 320 of the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act">Clean Water Act</a>. On the other hand, this SOP is a more hands-on and accessible document that describes a how-to approach for data management that we adopt as an organization. The SOP goes beyond the QMP by exposing the process and ideas behind how we manage data at TBEP so that others can learn from our experience. We encourage you to also view our QMP to understand the literal benchmark we use to ensure quality of our data.</p>
<p>We actively work to apply open science to every activity we pursue to achieve our goals under the CCMP. Open science is a philosophy and set of tools to make research reproducible and transparent, in addition to having long-term value through effective data preservation and sharing <span class="citation">(Beck et al. <a href="#ref-Beck20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. We use a definition from the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/open-science/">Creative Commons</a> for open science as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practicing science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple key words from the definition that we can extract - collaborate, contribute, reuse, redistribute, reproduce. These concepts channel some of the ideas described by the FAIR principles (section <a href="keys.html#fair">3.2</a>). We can further elaborate on these key words by defining open science as a set of four core principles (Dan Gezelter <a href="http://openscience.org/what-exactly-is-open-science/" class="uri">http://openscience.org/what-exactly-is-open-science/</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Transparency in experimental methods, observations, and collection of data.</li>
<li>Public availability and reusability of scientific data.</li>
<li>Public accessibility and transparency of scientific communication.</li>
<li>The use of web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration and reproducibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why is this so important? Environmental science is very much in the business of applied science, meaning that research that is conducted to develop an understanding of the environment can be used to support the protection and management of a resource. We need to understand a problem before we can pursue actions to remedy a problem, especially if the wrong decision can be costly. Active and useful channels of communication must exist for the lessons learned from science to be applied to real world problems. Applied science can be facilitated with open science to create these channels.</p>
<p>Without getting too much into the history of how insular practices among academics have contributed to closed science, it’s useful to briefly discuss some of reasons why science may not be translated into action. As a generalization, researchers are trained to study and document details. Progress in science is based on 1) an intimate understanding of details that guide process and 2) convincing your peers through rigorous review that you actually understand the details you claim to understand. As a result, we catalog progress in ways that are true to the scientific process, often as dense texts with every last detail noted. Many researchers not being taught otherwise will often assume that this is an effective way to communicate scientific results to non-scientists. What we don’t realize is that those that need this information to make decisions do not communicate this way because they are not in the business of scientific discovery. Unless they have a personal interest, they don’t care about the science behind the decision, only that the science is right to justify the decision. The most ineffective approach for a scientist to inform environmental management is to deliver a dense 500 page report and assume it provides an effective vehicle for an environmental manager to make a rational decision. This is not applied science - it is “implied science” because we implicitly decide that our conventional modes of scientific communication will influence managment or policy.</p>
<p>In addition to communication barriers, other challenges to applied science include irreproducible results, information loss, inaccessible data, and opaque workflows (section <a href="background.html#whymanage">2.2</a>, Figure <a href="workflow.html#fig:divide">4.1</a>). These challenges affect how science is delivered to decision-makers, how much trust a decision-maker can have in the science behind the decision, and how likely the science can be used as a springboard for more science. Effective data management as a subset of the broader principles of open science can help bridge the “research-management divide” and help develop continuity of scientific products that can benefit the larger research community.</p>

<div id="the-open-science-cake" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> The open science cake</h3>
<p>Truly applied science facilitated by open science allows for research results or data to connect with different audiences along a spectrum. It allows research to be shared with other researchers, be connected with decision-makers, and be accessible to the general public. Where an individual consumes scientific information along the spectrum depends on their interest, need, or level of background knowledge about a subject. A solid technical foundation is a prerequisite for sharing information and open science methods allow various elements of the research foundation to be accessible to different end users. We meet our audience where they’re at, rather than assuming they can find their way to the details they need.</p>
<p>We can describe this metaphor as the <strong>open science cake</strong> (figure <a href="workflow.html#fig:cake">4.2</a>). We use this metaphor because everybody loves cake and it conveniently describes our philosophy to delivering science in an applied context. This delicious cake is a gradient of information from top to bottom. At the top, the information is more general (e.g., educational material for public consumption) or can be used to inform action (e.g., what needs to be done to remedy a problem). At the bottom, the information has specificity and forms the foundation for generality or action. The bottom of the cake is large, reflecting the decades of research and technical resources that are available to inform the management of Tampa Bay (our <a href="http://tbep.org/library">library</a>, for example). The bottom also includes resources that can be used to springboard additional research, such as analysis code and source datasets. Individuals at the top of the cake probably don’t want a slice at the bottom, but the slice they take from the top would not exist without support from the bottom.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cake"></span>
<img src="img/cake.png" alt="The open science cake showing the connection between research, environmental decisions, and the public."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.2: The open science cake showing the connection between research, environmental decisions, and the public.
</p>
</div>
<p>Most of our partners that we work with are professionals from resource management or local government agencies that have some vested interest in the protection and restoration of Tampa Bay. This is our primary audience that we can inform for decision-making. Broadly speaking, this is the audience that needs distilled information from research products but with a level of specificity that goes beyond education materials. These individuals are in the middle of the cake and the slices they take are actionable science products, such as interactive dashboards, automated report cards, and other decision support tools. The middle part of the cake is where conventional science becomes truly applied science.</p>
<p>The cake also emphasizes a vertical connection among the layers that allows an individual to take a slice as high or as low in the cake as they want. This is a critical principle of open science that speaks to accessibility of information at all levels of the scientific process. Most of the time, an individual will take a slice from the cut at the level that’s appropriate for their needs. However, we want our science (and data) to be transparent and accessible under the FAIR principles and someone can take a slice at a different level if they have a need to do so. This also speaks to developing a community of practice for open science - access to the tools and the ability to use them to reproduce or expand on existing products.</p>
<p>Our web products on the <a href="https://tbep.org/our-work/data-vizualization/">data visualization</a> section of our web page allow an individual to take slices of the cake at different levels. The website is setup as a series of cards (cakes) for each reporting product that act as an entryway (top of the cake) to different levels of each cake. If someone clicks on the <a href="https://tbep.org/water-quality-report-card/">Water Quality Report Card</a> for example, they get to a web page that has very general information about the reporting product and links to our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/124FXmLcXKYUf3ktaVOvFejndiPS0m7K7/view?usp=sharing">summary pdf</a> that distills over forty years of water quality data for the Bay. There are links on the right side of the page that provide access to the building blocks of the report card, including the online dashboard, source code for the report card, build status of the report (more on this in section <a href="workflow.html#automation">4.1.3</a>, citable DOI, and technical documents that describe the science behind our water quality assessment approach. These links provide the path to the lower levels of the cake.</p>
</div>
<div id="automation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> How do we build the cake?</h3>
<p>The cake is a useful metaphor to describe how we apply open science to achieve applied science, but how is this done in practice? How are the layers of the cake actually linked to one another? We use several open source programming tools to link source data to reporting products with the goal of producing the most timely information for decision-makers with minimal overhead by internal staff. In this section, we describe these tools and how we link them together to crate a workflow that is both automated and reproducible.</p>
<p>The workflow we use to link source data to reporting products for our annual water quality assessment is shown in figure <a href="workflow.html#fig:osworkflow">4.3</a>. The process begins by accessing an external data source from our partners. In this case, this workflow accesses a spreadsheet of water quality data on an <a href="ftp://ftp.epchc.org/EPC_ERM_FTP/WQM_Reports/">FTP site</a> maintained by the Hillsborough county Environmental Protection Commission. These data are processed with a suite of open source tools, including R, RStudio, relevant data wrangling packages, and tools for document preparation. The open source tools we’ve created are also hosted online on GitHub which serves two goals. First, providing the tools on GitHub makes them discoverable and accessible to others and second, they are integrated into an automated process to make sure the most current data are used. Once the build process is done, the final products as a Shiny web application and our two-page PDF report are hosted on the TBEP website.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The core component of this entire workflow is the <a href="https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/">tbeptools R package</a> <span class="citation">(Beck et al. <a href="#ref-Beck21" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. This is software that was developed using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R programming language</a> to read, analyze, and visualize data that we use to report on progress in achieving CCMP goals. Most of the data tools on our web page depend on functions within the tbeptools package to work with the raw data provided from our partners. Although tbeptools is primarily used by TBEP staff, the package is provided free of use (under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a>) for anyone interested in exploring the data on their own. Importantly, all source code is available on GitHub so that anyone with an interest can understand exactly what is done to process the data we use for reporting. This is a literal definition of transparency.</p>
<p>There are several functions in the tbeptools package that are built specifically for reporting on water quality, all of which are explained in detail in the <a href="https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/articles/intro.html">introduction vignette</a> for the tbeptools package. A “vignette” in the R world is a plain language document that explains how to use functions in a package. Currently, the tbeptools package includes five vignettes, one for each indicator that has reporting functions available in the package:</p>

<p>Each vignette is setup similarly by explaining the functions used to read, analyze, and visualize the data. In fact, every function name in the package is named accordingly, e.g., <code>read_transect()</code> imports seagrass data, <code>anlz_transectave()</code> estimates annual averages of seagrass frequency occurrence, and <code>show_transect()</code> creates a plot of the transect data. The examples in the vignette explain how to use the functions and what each function does when working with the data.</p>
<p>The functions in tbeptools used to read data into R were all built to ensure the most timely data are used for analysis. Each function uses a workflow shown in figure <a href="#fig:readchk"><strong>??</strong></a>, where a set of internal checks are done to see if the data are available on your computer, compares the data to the online source, and downloads the most recent version if your current version is either not yet downloaded or out of date. This process also ensures that any downstream reporting products are using the most current data. For example, the web page for the</p>
