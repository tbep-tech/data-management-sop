Understanding these concepts and why they’re important will facilitate the development and curation of open data for others to use - it will save you time in the future. 3.1 General concepts What are data, i.e., from the perspective of the researcher/agency scientist/manager? Workflow (e..g, operationalizing Twitter scraping), dataset (field/lab data), model products, etc. Ask yourself, who is going to use this and how do I make their (my) lives “easier” by opening the data using FAIR principles? What is open data? The FAIR principles (very broad, emphasize throughout), also general open science definition and how data relates to open science (channel PeerJ paper distinction Beck et al. (2020)) What is metadata and why do we need it? 3.2 Specific concepts types of data products (e.g., raw data, models, synthesized/derived data, etc.) or types of data (flat file, spatial, disparate) Tabular data The wrong approach an overview of tidy data, can a machine read it? normalized tables (including discussion of key variables), what are unique ids (e.g., tberf oyster, how did I make the unique id?), facilitate standard DB queries metadata documentation (min requirements, relevant standards) data dictionaries, naming conventions where do data live long-term, what’s a doi, considering a data paper, federated repository, etc. GitHub repository Stable URL Official repository References "],["workflow.html", "Section 4 Data Management Workflow 4.1 The TBEP approach 4.2 How can you manage data?", " Section 4 Data Management Workflow This section describes our approach to managing data internally, to help describe what we do and why we do it.
