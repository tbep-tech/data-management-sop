# Background {#background}

## Importance of data

* Data are the foundation of all research products and management decisions
* A data definition, e.g., raw information in flat files, synthesized/derived datasets, models, etc. 
* How data are used in applied research/environmental sciences

## Why we need to effectively manage data

* What happens when data are not managed properly - Figure 1, bit-rot
* Professorware
* Benefits of a data management workflow
* Applications in open science

## Goals/objectives of this document

* What it is, what it is not - including what makes TBEP different from other organizations, i.e., we have hands in lots of projects vs one central product (e.g., OHI), so our SOP needs to be generalizable
* Develop pathway for metadata
* Intended audience
