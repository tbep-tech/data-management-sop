## Importance of data

Informed decisions about how we manage behaviors and actions that affect the environment cannot be made without data.  As a fundamental part of the scientific method, data provide the raw information for conclusions on the validity of a hypothesis that informs our understanding of natural processes.  Environmental research develops this understanding to support informed decisions for managing natural resources and data are the foundation for research. As methods for managing environmental resources continue to evolve, so does our understanding of data beyond its conventional role in an academic setting.

When we discuss "data" we often describe a very general term that has different meanings for different people.  In a research setting, data can be the results of an experimental analysis or field survey as tabular information in it's simplest form.  For environmental managers, data can mean the long-term record of routinely collected and updated monitoring information to assess status and trends of a natural resource.  Even further, data can be highly aggregated and novel products created through complex meta-analyses of independent datasets.  In all cases, the need to describe a dataset, its purpose and origin, and to identify a permanent and long-term home for data is critical to ensure forward progress in both research and how research informs environmental management. 

This document describes one approach to address data management needs for the long-term restoration and protection of natural resources in Tampa Bay and its watershed.  We are inclusive of multiple definitions of data from simple spreadsheets to more complicated workflows for generating reporting products that support environmental decisions. This broad net is purposeful to account for both the variety of data we use as a program and the diversity of partner agencies we depend on to achieve our mission.  The management of environmental resources combines a healthy mix of conventional science with consensus driven decisions, often with strong regulatory overtones.  The foundation for all of these processes requires a robust approach for working with data that promotes trust and validity in the environmental decision and to ensure the science continues to progress without reinventing the wheel.    

## Why we need to effectively manage data

There are many reasons why data may not be effectively managed, chief among which is that it can be tedious and unglamorous work that is often an afterthought.  The value of investing a little time in managing a dataset can have long term benefits, but these values may not be obvious or realized in the short-term.  This leads to many "orphaned" datasets and data products that at one time had a known origin and purpose, but over time this information is lost because it is not initially documented or made available in a location that is findable and accessible by others.  

A classic graphic in Michener et al. [@Michener97] demonstrates how knowledge of a data product is lost over time (Figure \@ref(fig:michener)). As a research team publishes a paper, the information content of the data and metadata is at an all time high because the ideas and concepts have been intensely studied and evaluated in the months leading up to publication.  After publication, researchers move on to other projects or responsibilities and specific details about the intial project are lost rapidly as attention is focused elsewhere.  At longer time scales, other factors can contribute to the erosion of information content, including career changes through retirement or staff turnover or accidental loss of information (laptop takes a bath, lab fires, etc.).

```

The final step in Figure \@ref(fig:michener) leading to absolute and complete loss of information on a data product is death of an investigator. Although a bit morbid, this is a very real and preventable problem in the process of discovery that can you lead down the frustrating path of reconstructing a data product's origin through scouring historical records that have little to no descriptive information. As a remedy, many research teams have adopted the "bus factor" term as motivation to prevent this problem. The bus factor is an informal measurement of the relative risk associated with loss of information if an investigator was to, hypothetically, be hit by a bus (alternatively, the "lottery factor" describes departure of an individual if they were to win the lottery).  Data sets or workflows that have a high bus factor are at risk of being orphaned with the hypothetical loss of a team member.    

The costs of not effectively managing your data can vary, but each is a byproduct of neglecting an investment in data management.  In fact, you an probably recall several past instances when poor data management has come back to haunt you.  Here are a few examples, some from my own experience and some from others: 

1) A collaborator calls you on the phone asking about a historical dataset from an old report.  You spend several hours tracking down this information because you don't know where it is. The data you eventually find and provide to your collaborator has no documentation and they don't know how to use it or use it inappropriately. 
1) You receive a deliverable from a project partner that was stipulated in a scope of work.  This deliverable comes in multiple formats with no reproducible workflow to recreate the datasets.  You are unable to verify the information, eroding your faith in the final product and making it impossible to update the results in the future.
1) An annual reporting product requires using new data each year.  The staff member in charge of this report spends several days gathering the new data and combining it with the historical data.  Other projects are on hold until this report is updated.  Stakeholders using this report to make decisions do not trust or misunderstand the product because the steps for its creation are opaque. 

In addition to the above examples, a more general issue is stifled creativity.  The use of other people's data and services [i.e., "OPEDAS"; @Mons18] to generate novel research or data products is increasingly common, particularly in the last twenty plus years with the advance of internet communications.  Entire disciplines and new methods have been developed around this idea [e.g., meta-analysis; @Carpenter09; @Lortie14].  The generation of new data that have an incomplete history or that lack metadata documentation is a disservice to both the researcher that created the data and the larger scientific community that could benefit from using this information.  As a result, scientific progress will not continue as rapidly as it could if data products are discoverable and openly available. Poor data stewardship leads to:

* Less collaboration in the research community
* Increased siloing among management institutions
* Less creative approaches to managing environmental resources

Poor data management can also lead to peculiar or entrenched workflows that may work for an individual but are not scalable or translatable for use by others.  Many of us, myself included, have our own preferences for how we manage our data that simply "works for us", either because we learned out of necessity because the work had to be done or we've just been doing it a certain way for so long that it now seems normal despite being inefficient or prone to error.  In extreme cases, this can lead to workflows that may seem legitimate but are problematic because they lack a formality or standards that are common in other disciplines.  

@Mons18 describes "professorware" as one type of workflow for handling or generating data that address a novel intellectual challenge, which are important in research or discovery, but are not scalable or sustainable in the long run.  Think of a pet project where you've written some code to achieve a certain task.  It might be clunky, but you're proud of it because it gets the job done on your computer and saves you from having to do a task by hand.  These workflows can often masquerade as novel "software packages" that do great things, which they often and can do, but they lack support in the sense that they're not often developed using community standards or best practices for long-term use or scalability.  This is especially problematic when these workflows are embedded into larger systems for managing data.  If one piece of the system lacks provenance or support, it puts the larger data management system at risk.  

## Open Science 

The open science approach provides a philosophy and set of tools to help address the costs of poor data management.  Before we proceed, we need to make a distinction between the broader concept of open science and open data as one component of the former.  Many of the guidelines and examples in this SOP fall broadly under the open science umbrella (or cake as you'll see later), but it's important to understand how data management includes a set of tools that are part of, but not exhaustive of, the entire open science toolbox.  Conversely, many open science tools that can be applied to other management scenarios that are broadly applicable can also benefit data management. 

An example may be helpful.  A key component of data management that leads to more open sharing is curation of metadata.  Although metadata can be created in an open environment and is often created for the purpose of facilitating openness, it is an entity that can be created completely in isolation with a closed workflow.  So, when we talk about metadata, the assumption is that its creation is to promote sharing and transparency for open data, whereas metadata by themselves are only so useful in how they can facilitate the latter.  

On the other hand, broader open science principles that support a culture of sharing can also have value for research workflows that generally have nothing to do with data.  For example, the "public school of thought" for open science focuses on making science more accessible to the general public, e.g., through citizen science initiatives or science blogging [@Fecher14].  Although this approach doesn't deal explicitly with best practices for data management, this mentality certainly has benefit for creating a culture that appreciates and learns from science, which logically leads to discussions on the importance of data.  

For these reasons, this document covers many topics that may fall squarely under the realm of data management, while at other times advocating for more general open science principles with the intent of supporting a culture of better data management. 

## The TBEP philosophy

The Tampa Bay Estuary Program is one of [28 National Estuary Programs](http://nationalestuaries.org/) designated by Congress to restore and protect "estuaries of national significance." Many of these estuaries are heavily urban (i.e., economic, recreational, cultural importance) and have had historical or ongoing issues contributing to poor environmental quality.  The recovery of Tampa Bay is an exceptional story of an urban estuary that demonstrates the value of the NEP approach to restoring and protecting environmental resources. Through a coordinated regional effort of environmental professionals, utility operators, and local politicians, nutrient loads to the Bay have been reduced by ~2⁄3 from 1970s levels and seagrasses have recovered to a 1950s benchmark extent [@Greening14;@Sherwood17].  What makes this story even more remarkable is that the human population in the Tampa Bay watershed continues to increase while nutrient loads into the Bay continue to decline. 

The TBEP is a key facilitator among the many local partners that have an interest in the region's natural resources. Our approach to facilitating is guided by several documents, including an [Interlocal Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJcWxmc5SeyDTqiCQ3MLQGWEY_EDGtZT/view?usp=sharing), a [Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan](https://indd.adobe.com/view/cf7b3c48-d2b2-4713-921c-c2a0d4466632), and a [Strategic Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xohuoaHDxNHRqgXoOHdI37FpWvac_rn/view?usp=sharing).  In simple terms, these documents respectively describe *who* we work with, *what* we need to accomplish, and *how* it can be accomplished.  

Open science and data management have everything to do with how we facilitate Bay management.  Our recent update to the Strategic Plan specifically speaks to our use of open science as 1) a general direction for how we accomplish our work to achieve the desired future state of Tampa Bay and 2) as a unique value proposition that TBEP offers within its sphere of influence (more on this later).  We articulate the use of open science at TBEP as a cornerstone strategy: 

> Be the primary source of trusted, unbiased, and actionable science for the Tampa Bay estuary, recognizing that open science principles will serve the Program’s core values.

As a program with only seven employees, we realize our success depends on the work of our many partners.  We can use open science principles internally, but we can have a much greater impact if who we work with understands the value of open science and actively works towards adopting its principles in their own workflows.  We are actively supporting our partners through this journey through an open science subcommittee that has a goal of developing a community of practice that works and learns together to navigate the open science landscape.  Our [roles and responsibilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w6dVTwfYYDRVzGPXy0jyHxV4mwOutEY_ISMP1oAdZ_c/edit) document explains how we are accomplishing this goal.

Our program rests on a strong foundation of [research](https://tbep.org/our-work/library/) that guides decision-making for Tampa Bay covering nearly three decades of science and collaboration.  Although great strides have been made, we can do better as an organization and this starts with better data management practices guided by open science principles.  The details of this approach and why we've adopted open science as our own are explained fully in section \@ref(philo).
