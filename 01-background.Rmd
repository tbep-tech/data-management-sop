## Importance of data

* Data supports research, research supports environmental management
* A data definition, e.g., raw information in flat files, synthesized/derived datasets, models, etc. 
* How data are used in applied research/environmental sciences
     * Research products support management frameworks, research products are data
     * Monitoring programs produce data to track progress in achieving management goals
     * Data and processes behind decision-support tools may be opaque

## Why we need to effectively manage data

* What happens when data are not managed properly
     * Loss of information over time, Figure \@ref(fig:michener)
     * Lack of trust in the process
     * Increased siloing
     * Increased costs

```{r michener, echo = F, fig.cap = 'Loss of information over time in the absence of data management [@Michener97]'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/michener.png')
```

* Bit rot, link rot [@Vines14]
* Professorware [@Mons18] - objects that address a novel intellectual challenge, a critical aspect of research (academic or industry) required for incremental progress, but lacking support (i.e., not scalable or sustainable).  This is problematic when these tools are embedded into larger workflows (insert post-doc bakery meme)
* Benefits of a data management workflow
* Applications in open science

## The TBEP philosophy

* How TBEP is using open science to manage internal/external data and how is this increasing transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency of our reporting products
* TBEP Open Science Subcommittee, building the community of practice

## Goals/objectives of this document

* Goal: Motivate internal staff and external partners to become stewards of their data by demonstrating the value of open data practices and providing a road map to achieving this goal.
* Link to QMP [@tbep1620] and distinction between the documents
* What it is, what it is not - including what makes TBEP different from other organizations, i.e., we have hands in lots of projects vs one central product (e.g., OHI), so our SOP needs to be generalizable
     * It is: An overview document explaining the TBEP approach to data management, explains philosophy in details, tools we have developed
     * It is: A cookbook describing how to manage datasets in an open science framework, including considerations before, during, and after a project, with full realization that data management should begin during project planning but often does not
     * It is not: A definitive overview of best practices for data management
     * It is not: A definitive overview of available online services for opening data, but we lean towards use of specific platforms that we find useful
* Intended audience: TBEP internal staff and external partners, targeted towards technical staff in the latter case while also appealing to managers/admin that can create space to foster better practices for data management, also see TBEP QMP sec 1.3 
* Document structure
