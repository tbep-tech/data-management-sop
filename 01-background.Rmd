## Importance of data

* Data are the foundation of all research products that can be used to inform management decisions
* A data definition, e.g., raw information in flat files, synthesized/derived datasets, models, etc. 
* How data are used in applied research/environmental sciences

## Why we need to effectively manage data

* What happens when data are not managed properly - Figure \@ref(fig:michener)
* Professorware [@Mons18]
* Benefits of a data management workflow
* Applications in open science

```{r michener, echo = F, fig.cap = 'Loss of information over time in the absence of data management [@Michener97]'}

## The TBEP philosophy

* How TBEP is using open science to manage internal/external data and how is this increasing transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency of our reporting products
* TBEP Open Science Subcommittee, building the community of practice

## Goals/objectives of this document

* Goal: Motivate internal staff and external partners to become stewards of their data by demonstrating the value of open data practices and providing a road map to achieving this goal.
* Link to QMP [@tbep1620] and distinction between the documents
* What it is, what it is not - including what makes TBEP different from other organizations, i.e., we have hands in lots of projects vs one central product (e.g., OHI), so our SOP needs to be generalizable
     * It is: An overview document explaining the TBEP approach to data management, explains philosophy in details, tools we have developed
     * It is: A cookbook describing how to manage datasets in an open science framework, including considerations before, during, and after a project, with full realization that data management should begin during project planning but often does not
     * It is not: A definitive overview of best practices for data management
     * It is not: A definitive overview of available online services for opening data, but we lean towards use of specific platforms that we find useful
* Develop pathway for metadata documentation
* Intended audience: TBEP internal staff and external partners, targeted towards technical staff in the latter case while also appealing to managers/admin that can create space to foster better practices for data management, also see TBEP QMP sec 1.3
