# Final Words {#final}

* emphasis on "something is better than nothing", fully open is ideal but difficult to achieve, e.g., "good enough practice" [@Wilson17]
* Just remember FAIR
* evolving tools
* trying to be both a domain expert and data expert will spread you thin [@Mons18, p. 27, 36], look to the helpers/community (Figure \@ref(fig:codehero)) 
* Join the community of practice by getting involved in the [Open Science Subcommittee](https://tbep.org/our-work/boards-committees/technical-advisory-committee/#open-science)
